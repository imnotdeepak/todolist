# todolist

this is the first project on my github account, being a to do list! this runs completely on command line, so no extra windows or websites or anything

dependencies you need to run this: python

how to use it:

to add a task: python3 list.py add --item-text "put whatever task you want in between these parentheses"

to cross out a task (the number corresponds to the number that is with the task): python3 list.py done --item-number number

to see the list of tasks: python3 list.py list
